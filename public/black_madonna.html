                    The Black Madonna is a multi-faceted presence who has multiple meanings associated 
                    with her.  She bears many different names according to time and place and is a 
                    universal figure found in many cultures around the world.

                    While the Black Madonna encompasses celestial and underworld dimensions, she is 
                    also about the essential life force which underlies life on earth. Through her 
                    power, the Black Madonna is able to restore chaos to its original state of purity 
                    and she represents the principles of fecundity and fertility.  In particular, she 
                    is associated with the properties of black soil and rock.
                    
                    As a force and a spiritual experience, the Black Madonna is of particular interest 
                    to those working with the subtle layers of the earth and nature as well as sacred 
                    places. 
                    
                    Black Madonnas are often a ‘marker’ for places with special land formations or 
                    earth energies, restorative waters, or subterranean earth movements.
                    
                    The Terra Numina approach to Black Madonna work is to enable participants to 
                    experience the qualities of this Black Madonna force and the particular subtle 
                    earth energies that can be tapped into in Black Madonna places.
